Compound Interest Formula

A = P(1+r/n)^(n*t)
 
P = principal amount (the initial amount you borrow or deposit)
r  = annual rate of interest (as a decimal)
t  = number of years the amount is deposited or borrowed for.
A = amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
n  =  number of times the interest is compounded per year 
 
 

Example:

An amount of $1,500.00 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly. What is the balance after 6 years?
Solution:

Using the compound interest formula, we have that
P = 1500, r = 4.3/100 = 0.043, n = 4, t = 6. Therefore,
Example Solution
So, the balance after 6 years is approximately $1,938.84.
